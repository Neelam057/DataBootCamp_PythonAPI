Project Overview

Part 1: WeatherPy
The WeatherPy assignment aims to analyze the relationship between weather variables (Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed) and latitude. The data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API. The project generates several scatter plots to visualize the relationships between these weather variables and latitude and computes linear regression to analyze the correlation in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

Part 2: VacationPy
The VacationPy assignment leverages the weather data and uses the Geoapify API to help find the best vacation destinations based on weather conditions. For each city in the dataset, the program visualizes the city on a map, filters cities based on ideal weather conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.), and uses the Geoapify API to find nearby hotels within 10,000 meters.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x: The primary programming language used for the project.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating the plots and visualizations.
Seaborn: Used for advanced visualizations and statistical plots.
SciPy: For performing linear regression.
Requests: For making API requests to OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify.
hvplot: For map visualizations.
Geoapify API: Used to fetch nearby hotels based on coordinates.
